# Exercise Codes

This repository contains my personal collection of programming exercises and practice problems.  
The goal is to track my learning progress and build strong fundamentals in programming, data structures, and algorithms.

## Contents
- Basic Python programs  
- Object-oriented programming exercises  
- Algorithm and data structure practice  
- Small experiments and learning notes  

## Purpose
- Practice core programming concepts  
- Maintain a history of solved exercises  
- Improve problem-solving and coding discipline  

## Usage
Each folder or file represents an independent exercise.  
Most programs are self-contained and can be run directly.

## Notes
- Code quality improves over time as learning progresses.  
- Some solutions may be intentionally simple for clarity.

## License
This repository is for learning and personal reference.
